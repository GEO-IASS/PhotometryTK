Prerequisite
==================================================

The user needs to have installed:

  1. GDAL 1.8+
  2. Boost 1.36+
  3. RabbitMQ C Client or ZeroMQ
  4. Protobuf
  5. NASA Vision Workbench from GitHub:
       https://github.com/visionworkbench/visionworkbench
     built with Plate Module and optional GDAL support

Please follow those distribution's install guides for installation
instructions.


Installation Instruction
==================================================

Photometry TK uses the CMake build system. These instructions will
assume you only have access to the terminal program 'cmake'. However,
setting configuration options is easier with the 'ccmake' tool.

  1. cd PhotometryTK source directory
  2. mkdir build
  3. cd build
  4. cmake .. -DVISIONWORKBENCH_ROOT:PATH=${YOUR VW INSTALL DIR}
              -DBoost_ROOT:PATH=${YOUR BOOST INSTALL DIR}
              -DPROTOBUF_ROOT:PATH=${YOUR PROTOBUF INSTALL DIR}

Here are some additional options you can set in the cmake call:
  *  Use RPATHs in resulting libraries
              -DENABLE_RPATHS:BOOL=ON
  *  Set the installation directory for PhotometryTK
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${YOUR INSTALLATION DIR}

After you have configured your build settings correctly, the following
instruction detail how to compile Photometry TK. These commands are
operating GNU Make, and thus the multiprocess options of -j N apply
here.
  5. make
  6. make install


Running unit tests
==================================================

Photometry TK has some unit testing available to insure proper
function. To operate them, change directory to your build directory.
  7. make check

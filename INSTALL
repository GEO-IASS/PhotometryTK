Prerequisite
==================================================

The user needs to have installed:

  1. GDAL 1.8+
  2. Boost 1.50+
  3. RabbitMQ C Client or ZeroMQ
  4. Protobuf
  5. NASA Vision Workbench from GitHub:
       https://github.com/visionworkbench/visionworkbench
     built with GDAL support

Please follow those distribution's install guides for installation
instructions.


Installation Instructions
==================================================

Photometry TK uses the CMake build system. These instructions will
assume you only have access to the terminal program 'cmake'. However,
setting configuration options is easier with the 'ccmake' tool.

  1. cd PhotometryTK source directory
  2. mkdir build
  3. cd build
cmake .. -DVISIONWORKBENCH_ROOT:PATH=${YOUR VW INSTALL DIR}   \
         -DBOOST_ROOT:PATH=${YOUR BOOST INSTALL DIR}          \
         -DPROTOBUF_ROOT:PATH=${YOUR PROTOBUF INSTALL DIR}     

Here are some additional options you can set in the cmake call:
  *  Use RPATHs in resulting libraries
              -DENABLE_RPATHS:BOOL=ON
  *  Set the installation directory for PhotometryTK
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${YOUR INSTALLATION DIR}

After you have configured your build settings correctly, the following
instruction detail how to compile Photometry TK. These commands are
operating GNU Make, and thus the multiprocess options of -j N apply
here.
  5. make
  6. make install


Running unit tests
==================================================

Photometry TK has some unit testing available to insure proper
function. To operate them, change directory to your build directory.
  7. make check


Installing and running SfS (shape-from-shading)
==================================================

The SfS program is src/tools/sfs.cc. It depends on ISIS. It can be
compiled by invoking cmake from the build directory:

cmake .. -DENABLE_SFS=TRUE <options as above> <ISIS options> 

How to set the ISIS options is described in INSTALL.isis.

Then type 'make'. Once the program is compiled, it can be run as
follows:

export ISISROOT=<your ISIS install dir>
export ISIS3DATA=<your ISIS data dir>

sfs image.cub DEM.tif metadata_dir num_iter

The metadata directory is expected to have files describing the sun
and spacecraft positions.

Sample datasets are included in PhotometryTK/src/photk/tests/. Doing
'make check' will run this program (with just one iteration, normally
around 20-100 are required).
